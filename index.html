                        The contemporary interpretation of the teachings of the Holy Prophet and the Ahlul Bayt (peace
                        be upon them) is an essential need of the present era. We live in a time when women, equipped
                        with modern education, are actively contributing to various fields through their individual
                        efforts and practical engagement. Therefore, it is imperative to provide them with a sound
                        religious and intellectual vision.
                        Murabbi-e-Millat Hujjat-ul-Islam wal-Muslimeen Al-Hajj Maulana Syed Haider Mehdi Zaidi (may his
                        blessings continue) recognized the needs of contemporary women and founded a distinguished
                        religious institution to connect them with moral values and authentic Islamic principles.
                        To further this noble mission, he and his esteemed wife, Syeda Rabab Zaidi, established a
                        prominent religious institution on 20 Jumadi al-Thani 1415 AH (corresponding to 24 November
                        1994) under the name Jamiatuz Zahra in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh.

                        Jamiatuz Zahra is an academic, Islamic, and madrasa-style seminary institution. It holds the
                        distinction of being the first Shia girls' madrasa in India.
                        Today, the institution is widely recognized for providing comprehensive religious and moral
                        education to girls and, through them, continues to play a significant role in the reform and
                        development of society across various cities in India.

                    <span class="founder__title-role">Founder of Jamiatuz zahra</span>
                    <div class="founder__divider"></div>
                    <p class="founder__bio">

                        Murabbi-e-Millat Alhajj Maulana Syed Haider Mehdi Zaidi (T.S.) was a visionary scholar,
                        reformer, and devoted servant of Islam whose life was dedicated to the revival of authentic
                        religious education and the moral upliftment of society.

                        At a time when structured and advanced religious education for women was limited and
                        opportunities were scarce, he foresaw the urgent need to establish an organized institution that
                        would provide authentic Islamic scholarship along with disciplined moral training. His vision
                        was not merely to open a madrasa, but to initiate a transformative movement for women’s Islamic
                        education.

                        By the grace of Allah, he formally established Jamia-tuz-Zahra on 20th Jamadi al-Thani 1415 AH
                        (24 November 1994). This historic foundation marked a new chapter in women’s Hawza education,
                        creating a platform where knowledge and tarbiyat would go hand in hand.

                        He profoundly stated:

                        “Educating a man educates an individual, but educating a woman educates an entire society.”

                        This belief became the cornerstone of his mission. He understood that empowered, knowledgeable,
                        and morally grounded women shape generations and strengthen the very fabric of the Ummah.

                        Through relentless effort, sacrifice, and unwavering reliance upon Allah, he laid strong
                        institutional foundations built upon discipline, sincerity, and academic excellence. He firmly
                        believed that education must go beyond textbooks — it must refine character, strengthen faith,
                        and prepare individuals to serve the Ummah with integrity and wisdom.

                        Maulana Zaidi (T.S.) was known for:

                        His deep commitment to authentic Islamic teachings

                        His emphasis on structured tarbiyat and discipline

                        His dedication to women’s religious empowerment

                        His ability to inspire unity, sincerity, and service

                        His passing was deeply felt by scholars, students, and communities across regions. The large
                        gatherings, heartfelt tributes, and collective grief reflected the immense respect and love he
                        commanded. His departure created a profound void, yet his mission and vision continue to
                        illuminate the path forward.

                        Today, the continued growth and success of Jamia-tuz-Zahra stand as a living testimony to his
                        sincerity, foresight, and lifelong sacrifice.

                        May Allah elevate his ranks and grant him the highest rank in the hereafter.

                        Syeda Rabab Zaidi is a distinguished Islamic scholar, educator, and reformer with over three
                        decades of dedicated service in the field of religious education and women’s empowerment. Born
                        in Patna, India, she comes from a respected scholarly lineage tracing back to the Ahlul Bayt
                        (peace be upon them).

                        She completed her advanced Hawza studies at Jamiatuz Zahra (Qom, Iran) and holds a Bachelor’s
                        degree in Persian Literature. She was among the first Indian women to travel to Iran for formal
                        religious studies, marking a historic milestone in women’s Islamic education.

                        Since returning to India, she has played a pioneering role in establishing and leading
                        institutions for women’s religious education. Under her guidance, structured Hawza programs,
                        daily sections for university students, Qur’anic centers, and foundational maktab programs have
                        flourished. After the demise of her husband, Alhajj Maulana Syed Hiader Mahdi Zaidi(T.S) in
                        2011, she assumed full responsibility for the academic and administrative leadership of the
                        institution.

                        She is widely respected for her lectures across India and internationally, her dedication to
                        Tarbiyat, and her contributions to Islamic scholarship and community development. Her efforts
                        have been recognized with multiple national and international awards, including the prestigious
                        Goharshad International Award.

                            Education is not merely the transfer of knowledge; it is the shaping of character, the
                            nurturing of faith, and the preparation of responsible individuals who serve society with
                            sincerity and wisdom.

                            At Jamia-tuz-Zahra, our mission extends beyond academic excellence. We believe that true
                            success lies in combining authentic Islamic knowledge with disciplined living and continuous
                            tarbiyat. This is why our residential system plays a vital role in cultivating moral
                            strength, spiritual awareness, and intellectual growth.

                            Our goal is to prepare students who are firmly grounded in Islamic teachings, confident in
                            their identity, and capable of guiding others with compassion and understanding. Every
                            lesson, every routine, and every interaction within our institution is designed to instill
                            responsibility, sincerity, and devotion to Allah.

                            We strive to create an environment where knowledge is respected, discipline is embraced, and
                            character is refined. With the support of parents and the dedication of our teachers, we
                            continue this noble journey of nurturing future generations.

                            May Allah grant us sincerity in our efforts and success in our mission.
